# Impact Analysis of GoodThought NGO Initiatives
GoodThought NGO has been a catalyst for positive change, focusing its efforts on education, healthcare, and sustainable development to make a significant difference in communities worldwide. With this mission, GoodThought has orchestrated an array of assignments aimed at uplifting underprivileged populations and fostering long-term growth.

In this project, I engaged with the GoodThought PostgreSQL database, which encapsulates detailed records of assignments, funding, impacts, and donor activities from 2010 to 2023. This comprehensive dataset includes:

Assignments: Details about each project, including its name, duration (start and end dates), budget, geographical region, and the impact score.

Donations: Records of financial contributions, linked to specific donors and assignments, highlighting how financial support is allocated and utilized.

Donors: Information on individuals and organizations that fund GoodThoughtâ€™s projects, including donor types.
